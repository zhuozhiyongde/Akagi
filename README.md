# Before You Start

[YouTube Video for you to follow.](https://youtu.be/Z88Ncxbe2nw)

### You will need:

1. A `mjai_bot`. 
   1. A working one is already included [here](./mjai_bot/mortal).
      - Because the limit of the file size, the `mortal.pth` here is a tiny weak small model.
      - It is not recommended to use it in a real game.
      - You can get a better model from [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z2wjXUK8bN).
      - Or use the hosted model from the online server.
      - You can get the API key from [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z2wjXUK8bN).
   2. Or make your own one, check [Developer setcion](#developer).
2. Use Windows Terminal to open akagi for a nice looking TUI.
3. Proxifier or similar tools to redirect game client to the MITM port.

> [!TIP]
> Some people have wrote a __keygen__ for __Proxifier__, you can find it using __Google__.
> 
> Authors of this project are not responsible for any illegal actions taken by users.

> [!WARNING]  
> __Windows Terminal__ is required for user interface to work properly.
> Defalt Windows console will make the UI look ugly and not usable.

## File Structure

- `./Akagi/` - The main folder of the project.
  - `akagi/` - Contains the Textual UI for Akagi.
  - `logs/` - Contains the logs of the game.
  - `mitm/` - Contains the MITM proxy server.
    - `bridge/` - Contains the bridge between the game client and the server. This is for converting the game client protocol to MJAI protocol. You can make your own bridge here.
      - `majsoul/` - Contains the bridge for Majsoul.
      - `tenhou/` - Contains the bridge for Tenhou.
      - `amatsuki/` - Contains the bridge for Amatsuki.
  - `mjai_bot/` - Contains the MJAI bots.
    - `base/` - Base class for MJAI bots. Check it out if you want to make your own bot.
    - `*/` - MJAI bots. This is your mjai_bot. For example, `mortal/`.
  - `settings/` - Contains the settings of the project.
  - `run_akagi.py` - The main file to run the project.

## Bridge

To make a bridge, you need to implement two things:

1. `ClientWebSocketABC` in `mitm/bridge/mitm_abc.py`.
2. `Bridge` in `mitm/bridge/bridge_base.py`.

For `ClientWebSocketABC`, this is an mitmproxy addon, main goal is to convert the game client protocol to MJAI protocol, and push it in to `mjai_messages: queue.Queue[dict] = queue.Queue()`.
You can check the `mitm/majsoul/` for the example.

For `Bridge`, this is the main class for the bridge. You need to implement the `parse()` method to parse the byte content from the game client into `None | list[dict]`, you can check the `mitm/bridge/amatsuki/bridge.py` for the example.

## MJAI Bot

To make a MJAI bot, you need to implement the `Bot` class in `mjai_bot/base/bot.py`.

TODO: make an tsumogiri bot example.

## TODO

- [x] Three Player Mahjong support.
- [ ] RiichiCity support.
- [ ] Show which tile to discard after call for riichi.
- [ ] Show which tile to Kan after call for Kan (rare case).
